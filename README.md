# SMA-Dengue-Simulation

Simulation Project For SMA Mod <br/>
Members: Hui Ting, Jun Hao, Eugene, Keenan <br/>

This repo is for the SMA mod <br/>
We are building an agent based simulation model using javascript to simulate the transmission of the dengue virus <br/>

Project Development will be split into at most 5 phases <br/>

Phase 1:
-Building and People <br/>
-Mosquito population <br/>
-Increase number of people in system <br/>

Phase 2:
-Mosquito Transmission of disease to ppl <br/>
-Mosquito reproduction at water source <br/>
-Disease recovery <br/>
-Traps to curb mosquito growth <br/>

Phase 3:
-Random Water source/traps appearing and disappearing in response to a slider <br/>
-Sliders to control traps/water sources/human density in system <br/>

Phase 4:
-People entering or leaving the system <br/>
-Output graphs to see the outcome of our model <br/>
