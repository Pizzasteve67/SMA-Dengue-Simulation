# SMA-Dengue-Simulation

Simulation Project For SMA Mod
Members: Hui Ting, Jun Hao, Eugene, Keenan

This repo is for the SMA mod
We are building an agent based simulation model using javascript to simulate the transmission of the dengue virus

Project Development will be split into at most 5 phases

Phase 1:
-Building and People <br/>
-Mosquito population <br/>

Phase 2:
-Mosquito Transmission of disease to ppl <br/>
-Mosquito reproduction at water source <br/>
-Disease recovery <br/>

Phase 3:
-Random Water source appearing and disappearing in response to a weather slide <br/>
-Traps to curb mosquito growth <br/>
-People entering or leaving the system <br/>

Phase 4:
-Increase number of people in system <br/>
-Sliders to control people in system <br/>
-Output graphs to see the outcome of our model <br/>
