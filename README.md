# SMA-Dengue-Simulation
Simulation Project For SMA Mod


This repo is for the SMA mod
We are building an agent based simulation model using javascript to simulate the transmission of the dengue virus

Project Development will be split into at most 5 phases

Phase 1:
-Building and People
-Mosquito population

Phase 2:
-Mosquito Transmission of disease to ppl
-Mosquito reproduction at water source
-Disease recovery

Phase 3:
-Random Water source appearing and disappearing in response to a weather slide
-Traps to curb mosquito growth
-People entering or leaving the system

Phase 4:
-Increase number of people in system
-Sliders to control people in system
-Output graphs to see the outcome of our model
