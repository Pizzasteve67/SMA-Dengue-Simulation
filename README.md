# SMA-Dengue-Simulation

Simulation Project For SMA Mod <br/>
Members: Hui Ting, Jun Hao, Eugene, Keenan <br/>

This repo is for the SMA mod <br/>
We are building an agent based simulation model using javascript to simulate the transmission of the dengue virus <br/>

Project Development will be split into at most 5 phases <br/>

Phase 1:<br/>
-Add Buildings <br/>
-Add Mosquito agent<br/>
-Add Human agent<br/>

Phase 2:<br/>
-Mosquito Transmission of disease to ppl mechanism<br/>
-Mosquito reproduction mechanism (At water puddles)<br/>
-Disease recovery mechanism<br/>
-Traps to curb mosquito agent population <br/>

Phase 3:<br/>
-Random Water source/traps appearing and disappearing in response to a slider<br/>
-Sliders to control traps/water sources/human density in system<br/>
-Separate our models into 4 zones (Problem)<br/>
-Add output Statistics<br/>

Phase 4:<br/>
-People entering or leaving the system<br/>
-Output graphs to see the outcome of our model<br/>
-Fumigation<br/>
